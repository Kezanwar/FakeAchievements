## FAQ

**Q: Will this get me banned?**  
A: No, this addon only sends regular chat messages. It's purely for fun and doesn't modify game mechanics or break ToS.

**Q: Can other players tell it's fake?**  
A: Yes! The message format is different from real achievements. Anyone paying attention will know it's a joke. Use responsibly!

**Q: Can I add multiple achievements at once?**  
A: Not currently, but you can quickly send multiple by clicking saved achievements or typing new ones.

**Q: My guild doesn't find this funny...**  
A: Maybe try the Party channel instead? üòÖ
